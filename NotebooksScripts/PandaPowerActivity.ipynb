    "\n",
    "pandapower is an open‑source Python library for power system modelling and analysis. It stores information about a network and provides the functionality for running power-flow calculations, plotting, geospatial interpretability and saving that data. As the name suggests it is built on pandas with the network and power-flow results being stored within pandas dataframes.\n",

    "This is a very scaled down introduction to *pandapower* where we load in a JSON file using *pandapower* and use our previous knowledge of Pandas to explore and plot the data.\n",
