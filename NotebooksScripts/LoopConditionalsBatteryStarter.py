Battery Modeling Tutorial - Loops and Conditionals
This file demonstrates Python loops and conditional statements through 
a practical battery charging/discharging simulation over 10 time periods.

Learning objectives:
- Using for loops 
- Working with conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- List indexing and manipulation
- Variable assignment and updates

Complete the script by filling in the missing code sections marked with <---.

1) Initially, ignore any battery constraints e.g. max/min state of charge, max power, efficiency, degradation etc
2) Revisit your completed code from (1) and add battery constraints. 
    You could do this by adding more nested if statements, or using min/max functions when calculating battery power.
3) finally, consider how you would model battery efficiency and degradation over time.

This is a comment block or docstring which can span multiple lines. 
It is often used at the start of files to describe the file.
