    Function to calculate the size of a PV array that can fit on a building

    Parameters
    ----------
    building_width : float
        Width of building in metres.
    building_length : float
        Length of building in metres.
    roof_angle : float
        Angle of the roof from horizontal in degrees.
    pv_width : float
        Width of single PV panel in mm.
    pv_height : float
        Width of single PV panel in mm.
    pv_power : float
        Power of single PV panel in W.

    Returns
    -------
    total_panels : float
        Maximum number of PV panels that fit on the roof.
    total_power : float
        Total power of PV array in kW.
